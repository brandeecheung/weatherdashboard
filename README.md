# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a 5 day and current forecast using the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities in the US. This app will allow users to search for any specific cities forecast for 5 days and daily. The app incorporates the use of `localStorage` to store any persistent data from the users.
